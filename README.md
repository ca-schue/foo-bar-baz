= Just a dump for projects that I did out of curiosity

### wsorting (German)
A small program that uses ncurses to juxtapose sorting algorithms and allows the user to compare their speed.

The implementations are based on the algorithms described in Robert Sedgewick's book *Algorithms in C* (Computer Science Series). They served me mainly as an exercise for the corresponding lecture of my studies.
 * Version 1.0 - Quicksort and Selection Sort implemented (Oct. 2020)
 * Version 1.1 - Added German prompt that asks the user to enter a two-digit number that bounds the sorting interval (Nov. 2020)
 
### kightsTour (German)
A naive DFS approach written in C for the knight's tour problem: 
On a chessboard, the knight must find the shortest path from A to B.  It may only make the moves allowed for the knight ("two squares forward, one to the left or right").
The program was a personal exercise for the problem presented in the Deductive Systems lecture.

 * Version 1.0 - Inefficient, recursive depth-first search: Before each function call, the entire array is copied. (Oct. 2020)
 * Version 1.1 - Added German prompt that asks for start position and destination position. (Incl. error handling) (Oct.2020)
