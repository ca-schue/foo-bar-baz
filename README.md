### wsorting (German)
A small program that uses ncurses to juxtapose sorting algorithms and allows the user to compare their speed.

The implementations are based on the algorithms described in Robert Sedgewick's book *Algorithms in C* (Computer Science Series). They served me mainly as an exercise for the corresponding lecture of my studies.
 * Version 1.0 - Quicksort and Selection Sort implemented (Oct. 2020)
 * Version 1.1 - Added German prompt that asks the user to enter a two-digit number that bounds the sorting interval (Nov. 2020)
